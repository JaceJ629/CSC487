1.) Find the distance between objects 1 and 3 by using the formula provided on the slides. Notice that we have mixed type of attributes.

	Nominal:
	  A = 3
	  B = 2
	  C = 1
	  Range = 3 - 1 = 2

	Ordinal:
	  Excellent = 3
	  Good = 2
	  Fair = 1
	  Range = 3 - 1 = 2

	Numeric:
	  Min = 22
	  Max = 64
	  Range = 64 - 22 = 42


	Distance between 1 and 3:
	  Nominal = 3 - 1 = 2
	  Scaled = 2 / 2 = 1

	  Ordinal = 1 - 2 = -1
	  Scaled = -1 / 2 = -0.5

	  Numeric = 45 - 64 = -19
	  Scaled = -19 / 42 = -0.4524

	  Total distance = 1 - 0.5 - 0.4524 = 0.0476


3.) In the table below, determine whether passing a class has a dependency on attendance by using Chi-square test.
	
	Observed Frequencies:
	  Attended and Passed: 25
	  Attended and Failed: 6
	  Skipped and Passed: 8
	  Skipped and Failed: 15

	Expected Frequencies:
	  Attended and Passed: (31 * 33) / 54 = 18.94
	  Attended and Failed: (31 * 21) / 54 = 12.06
	  Skipped and Passed: (23 * 33) / 54 = 14.06
	  Skipped and Failed: (23 * 21) / 54 = 8.94
	
	Chi-square:
	  (25 - 18.94)^2 / 18.94 = 1.94
	  (6 - 12.06)^2 / 12.06 = 3.05
	  (8 - 14.06)^2 / 14.06 = 2.61
	  (15 - 8.94)^2 / 8.94 = 4.09
	
	Total Chi-square:
	  1.94 + 3.05 + 2.61 + 4.09 = 11.69
		
	Degrees of Freedom:
	  (2 - 1) * (2 - 1) = 1
	
	Critical Value (Î± = 0.05):
	  3.841

	Since 11.69 > 3.841, there is a significant dependency between passing a class and attendance.
